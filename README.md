# Conduit
an app for posting the articles, you can appply different tags for which you want feeds, something similar to Medium

### Concepts
This RealWorld app tries to show the following Android concepts:
* 100% Kotlin Codebase
* MVVM (Model View ViewModel) Architecture
* LiveData
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Jetpack Navigation Architecture

### Architecture
The project follows the general MVVM structure without any specifics. 

There are two _modules_ in the project 

* `app` - The UI of the app. The main project that forms the APK
* `api` - The REST API consumption library. Pure JVM library not Android-specific
